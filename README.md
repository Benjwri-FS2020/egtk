# EGTK - Oxford Airport 
London Oxford airport is a relatively small airport to the North West of London, which sees primarily private jets and general aviation aircraft.

The airport is unfortunately only available as a runway in the base simulator, and therefore this has become my first project while familiarizing myself with the SDK.

The airport has been constructed to be as close to the real thing within the contraints of the SDK and without custom models.
